# Kubernetes with Oracle DB #

## Workshop Overview ##

This lab show you a seamless integration between an application deployed inside the kubernetes cluster and an oracle database.

Using the REST database interface to provisioning new database containers, a PDB, or even cloning existing one. Allows to use any Oracle Database with multitenant option in a DBaaS fashion in any environment (cloud, on-prem or hybrid)

The complexity of managing the connections to the database is abstracted by the usage of the Oracle Connection Manager so to have a "standard" kubernetes developer experience.

The operator creates a secret containing all the info for the connection, the visibility of which can be limited to the application itself so to achieve isolation of credentials.

A full architecture could be the one presented in this diagram:
