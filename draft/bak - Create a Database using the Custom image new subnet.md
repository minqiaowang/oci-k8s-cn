# Create a Database using the Custom image

##Prepare the Network

1. In the VCN of the kubernetes cluser, create a new security list name my-private-seclist

   - ingress rule:
     - 10.0.0.0/16 TCP ALL 22
     - 10.0.0.0/16 TCP ALL 1521
   - egress rule:
     - 0.0.0.0/0 All Protocals

2. Create a new route table: my-route-table, using the exist NAT gateway as the target

   - 0.0.0.0/0 	NAT Gateway	oke-ngw-quick-...

3. Create a new private subnet named my-private-subnet.

   - CIDR Block: 10.0.50.0/24
   - Secrity List: my-private-seclist
   - Route Table: my-rout-table

   

## Download Marketplace Initialization Zip

1. Click [**here**](https://community.oracle.com/servlet/JiveServlet/download/1031489-6-462822/oci-db-app-script-examples.zip) to download the marketplace initialization zip file.
2. Save it to your downloads folder
3. Unzip the folder and locate the `StandardIO-db.cloud-init` file. You will need this later when you create your compute instance.



## Create Compute Instance

1. From OCI console, create a Compute Instance named **dbserver**.

2. Click Change Image, and select Oracle Images. Click the down arrow to select the database version.![image-20200327113751359](img/image-20200327113751359.png)

3. Select the 19c version from the image build.<img src="img/image-20200327113859165.png" alt="image-20200327113859165" style="zoom:50%;" />

4. Scroll down, accept the standards and conditions and click the **Select Image** button.![image-20200327114104402](img/image-20200327114104402.png)

5. Change VM Shape to VM.Standard2.2

6. Choose the VCN and the subnet(*my-private-subnet*) you created before.

7. Add SSH Public Key, so the Database Host can by access by bastion host.

8. Click on **Show Advanced Options**. Choose the correct compartment. Click on the **Choose Cloud-Init Script File**. Click **browse**.![image-20200327114627886](img/image-20200327114627886.png)

9. Select the extracted `StandardIO-cloud-init` script. There are multiple scripts dependent on the shape you want. For this lab, we will be using the Standard IO.

10. Click the **Create** button to create your instance. Your instance will be in the provisioning state for about 5 minutes. Verify that you chose the correct image. In a few minutes you can also verify that you have a public IP address. View the Work Requests at the bottom, this will show where your instance is.![image-20200327115120107](img/image-20200327115120107.png)

11. Once the instance moves to the `Running` state, You can ssh access the dbserver from your bastion server.

12. Using this command to monitoring the deployment progress:

    ```
    tail -f /u01/ocidb/buildsingle.log
    ```

     

13. You need wait more time about 15 minutes until the database setup is ready. You can write down the information of your dbserver. For example:

    - Private IP address: 10.0.50.3
    - Host Name: dbserver.myprivatesubnet.mycluster.oraclevcn.com

    The default Database inforamation is:

    - SID: ORCL
    - CDB Servicename: ORCL
    - PDB Servicename: orclpdb
    - password: Ora_DB4U

    You can check  the database status from the bastion host using the following command:

    ```
    [opc@oke-bastion oracle-db-operator]$ ssh -i ../labkey opc@10.0.50.3
